This client is mainly made for games that don't have state saving or restoring functionality;

To use this Client:
1. You place the "SavePaths.txt" and the "SaveClient.jar" files in the same folder.
2. You replace the 'SourcePath' with the complete path to the directory you want to save (the directory in which the game save files are stored).
3. You replace the 'TargetPath' with the path to the directory in which your saves will be stored.
4. Open in terminal the folder with the "SavePaths.txt" and the "SaveClient.jar" and type "java -jar SaveClient.jar help" and hit enter so you can read the user guide.
