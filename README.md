This client is mainly made for games that don't have state saving or restoring functionality;

To use this Client:
1. You download and extract the "JavaSavingClient.zip" file form the release page of this repo.
2. You extract it and place the extracted folder in your "Path" enviorment variable to be able to run it directly from the terminal (NOTE: it only works in bash or other unix shells, not in powershell or windows cmd prompt!!! If you want to run it from cmd prompt or powershell, follow step 5)
3. You replace the 'SourcePath' with the complete path to the directory you want to save (the directory in which the game save files are stored).
4. You replace the 'TargetPath' with the complete path to the directory in which your saves will be stored.
5. Open in terminal the folder with the "SavePaths.txt" and the "SaveClient.jar" and type "java -jar SaveClient.jar help" and hit enter so you can read the user guide.
